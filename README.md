# tailwindvsnotailwindbasichtml

This repository is a simple educational demo to illustrate the difference between default HTML rendering and Tailwind CSS styling.

- **index.html**
  This file shows a variety of HTML elements using only the browser's default styles (no Tailwind CSS).

- **tailwind/index.html**
  This file contains the same HTML elements, but includes Tailwind CSS for styling.
  You can compare the appearance and structure of both files to see how Tailwind CSS affects the look and feel of standard HTML elements.

**Purpose:**
This project is for educational purposes only, to help you understand how Tailwind CSS changes the presentation of HTML compared to the default browser styles.
